# Python Data Exploration

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

This project explored the **NYC High School Directory dataset** using **Python** in a Jupyter Notebook. The objective was to clean and structure the data, perform exploratory analysis, create visualizations, and extract meaningful insights about schools across different boroughs.

### âœ… Key Steps Completed

1. **Data loading & cleaning:**
   The dataset was imported into a pandas DataFrame, and column names were standardized (lowercase, underscores instead of spaces, removal of special characters).

2. **Filtering & analysis:**
   Schools in Brooklyn were isolated for targeted analysis. Specific questionsâ€”such as the number of unique schools and Grade 9 entry availabilityâ€”were answered.

3. **Grouping & summarization:**
   Data was aggregated by borough to calculate:

   * Number of schools
   * Average number of students per borough
   * Summary statistics for `grade_span_max`

4. **Visualizations:**
   Two bar charts were generated to highlight borough-level patterns:

   * [Number of Schools per Borough](/Number_of_Schools_per_Borough.png)
   * [Number of Students per Borough](Number_of_Students_per_Borough.png)

5. **Insights derived:**
   Three main observations were drawn from the analysis, detailed below.

### ðŸ§  Insights from Analysis

**1. Number of Schools vs. Student Population**
The number of schools generally aligns with borough population size, but the more important metric is the **average number of students per school**, which reveals deeper differences between boroughs.

**2. School Efficiency & Size**

* **Staten Island** and **Queens** show the **highest average student counts per school**, indicating larger and more densely populated schools.
* **Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Manhattan** have lower averages, suggesting a preference for smaller or more specialized schools.
  This may reflect differences in school types, resource allocation, or population density.

**3. Borough-Level Comparison**

* **Brooklyn** leads with both the largest number of schools and total students.
* **Queens**, however, operates with only 80 schools compared to the **Bronx** with 118, yet serves nearly twice as many students per school.
  This contrast highlights two distinct educational strategies: many smaller schools (Bronx, Brooklyn) vs. fewer but larger schools (Queens). Such findings are valuable for shaping educational policiesâ€”e.g., whether to build more large schools or distribute students across multiple smaller ones.
